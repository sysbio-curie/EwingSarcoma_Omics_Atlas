# Ewing sarcoma Omics Atlas for systems biology studies

The Ewing sarcoma Omics Atlas is created by the Computational Systems Biology of Cancer group in the framework of Horizon-2020 [iPaediatricCure](https://ipc-project.eu/) project

## Online catalogue of omics resources for Ewing Sarcoma

This constantly updated catalogue contains links to the omics datasets of 
various kinds that were generated with the purpose of studying the molecular mechanisms 
of Ewing sarcoma.

[Access the catalogue](https://sysbio-curie.github.io/EwSOmicsAtlas/index.html)

## Collection of pre-processed transcriptomic datasets mapped onto HUGO gene symbols

The collection currently contains 1983 transcriptomic profiles from Ewing Sarcoma tumors and cell lines under various perturbations,
including 740 scRNA-Seq profiles.
Of note: since various studies used different platform for transcriptomic profiling, some pre-processing should be applied in order to harmozine the datasets for joint analysis.
This collection is an easy way to exploit publicly available transcriptomics data in machine learning studies.
